"""Workers: sessions xsm starts, hands a task, and stops.

A worker is an ordinary session of either runtime that xsm launched on a
caller's behalf. Once it registers it is addressed like any other session;
what this module adds is the part around it — starting it, answering the
approvals it cannot ask a person for, and stopping it.

Where it runs follows from where the caller is (user decision, 2026-09-21):

- Inside tmux, the worker is the real TUI in a pane split off the caller's own
  pane. A person can watch it and answer its prompts there, and closing the
  pane ends it.
- Anywhere else, or with --background, it runs in the background: the same
  real TUI, in a window of a detached tmux session named xsm-workers. Nobody is
  at its screen, but it is a live session all the same — it takes messages the
  way any session does.
- Inside a multi-agent framework (Orca, herdr) xsm starts and stops nothing:
  managing workers belongs to the framework, and xsm only carries the
  cross-session messages the framework does not (user decision, 2026-09-21).

A worker is never `claude -p` or `codex exec`. Those run one prompt and are
gone: there is no session to send a message to, so there is nothing for xsm to
connect (user decision, 2026-09-22; an earlier version ran such "headless"
workers, and a headless Claude worker could not even be sent a message).

Nobody is at a background worker's screen, so what it would ask there comes to
a person through xsm instead of the person going to the screen: a folder-trust
screen before it starts, and a background Claude worker's permission prompts.
Its PermissionRequest hook records the request, tells the caller,
and waits for an answer: a person with `xsm approve`/`xsm deny`, or the caller's
agent running `xsm approve` on its user's reply. The agent never decides on its
own — approving its own worker unasked is the permission laundering the skill
forbids — but asking its user and acting on their words is the person deciding
(user decision, 2026-10-01; the reply is kept as `answered_by`).
