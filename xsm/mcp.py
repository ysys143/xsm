"""The xsm MCP server: channel tools for a session, over stdio.

Started by the session (Claude Code or Codex) and ending with it, so it is not
a resident process (ADR-0003). It exists for two reasons (ADR-0005):

- A decision recorded from a session must be the person's. `xsm_decide` asks
  them through MCP elicitation, and their answer comes back from the client to
  this server without passing through the model (measured on both runtimes,
  2026-09-22). The answer and the question are stored with the decision.
- A sandboxed Codex cannot write `~/.xsm` from its shell, but the MCP servers it
  starts run outside the sandbox (measured), so posting and reading go through
  here too.

The session is identified by this process's ancestry: the nearest `claude` or
`codex` ancestor is the session, and its registry record is the author. Codex
threads of one CODEX_HOME share one ancestor (the app-server daemon), so a
Codex call names its thread in `params._meta.threadId` and that decides; with
several live threads and no such id, the call is refused (Server.session).

    Every form tool acts only on this. It takes what the client reports: an
    accepted form whose `answer` is a non-empty string (one of `allowed`, when
    the form offers choices), unless `_meta.approvals_reviewer` says someone
    other than the user answered it. Anything malformed — an `action` that is
    not one of the three, a `_meta` or `content` that is not an object — is no
    answer, never an exception: an unhashable `action` once raised past serve()
    and took the server down, and a list `_meta` was read as no meta at all, so
    all six tools acted (second review, 2026-09-28). A client that answers
    forms by itself — a Claude Code Elicitation hook the user configured, say —
    reports it as the user's, and xsm cannot tell; that is outside what it can
    detect.

    Codex (0.158): its auto-review does not look at xsm's forms (it reviews only
    elicitations whose `_meta` asks for an approval), but approval_policy
    "never" (or a granular policy with MCP elicitations off) declines them
    without showing them, unless full-access form input is on for the thread.
    That bare decline is also what a person pressing Decline sends, so it is
    reported as either. A bare "your user did not allow it" read as a refusal
    nobody had given (a tester's report, 2026-09-28). `client` is the
    clientInfo.name from initialize, so the wording names Codex only when it
    is Codex. From a client known to show its forms, a decline is the person's
